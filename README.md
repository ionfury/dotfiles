# dotfiles

Repository for my dotfiles, including native portability on MacOS.

## Installation

### MacOS

Assuming at baseline that [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) is installed and available.

```sh
brew install go-task git
git clone https://github.com/ionfury/dotfiles.git --recurse-submodules ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles
task install:mac

zsh  
```
